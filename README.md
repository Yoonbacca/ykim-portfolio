## Description
This is a simple portfolio page for myself.

This project is an reflection of all the HTML/CSS concepts I've learned in the first two weeks of bootcamp. I first focused on typing out the general structure of the page in HTML. Here, I used the semantic HTML elements I learned in the previous module to keep the code clean and easy to read for screen readers. I also made sure than any image I added to the project has descriptive alt text.

The header, hero, and footer elements demonstrate the Flexbox techniques I've learned so far. The header element has reactive links that change color when the mouse pointer hovers over said links. These will scroll the user to the appropriate section when clicking. The bottom "Contact Me" links have the same hover behavior, however, these are linked to external locations. Both the header and footer have similar, but slightly different styling, so I opted to create unique selectors for each. Using justify and align properties, I was able to adjust the header bar and the footer to have the title on the left and links on the right. 

The first application is set to span the entire width of the page. The second and third are structured using CSS Grid, which allowed me to quickly have these images take up 50% of the screen when the viewport is wider than a mobile device. Hovering over these images will make the title and subtitles easier to read since a light blue background should appear behind the text. When the viewport narrows, the images align in a single column for easier viewing. Certain fonts also adjust in size in order to allow for easier viewing.

## How to Install and Run the Project 
You can either clone the repo and preview index.html within an IDE or access the page at https://yoonbacca.github.io/ykim-portfolio/

## How to Use the Project
As my skills develop, this page will transition from a learning tool to a legitimate portfolio for potential employers to view my work.
