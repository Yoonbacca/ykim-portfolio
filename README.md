![Portfolio Screenshot](/src/assets/screenshot.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to Yoon-Jae Kim's professional portfolio, a representation of my web developer's journey. This project showcases expertise using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS to offers a glimpse of the web development skills I've learned so far at Northwestern University's Fullstack Bootcamp.

## Technologies

- **React**: The portfolio leverages React for an interactive user experience.
- **Vite**: Vite enables efficient development with quick content previews.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS delivers a responsive and sleek design.
- **Prettier**: Prettier ensures code formatting consistency.
- **ESLint**: ESLint is used for static code analysis and maintaining code quality.
- **Getform**: Getform is integrated to handle the contact form and submissions.

## Navigation and Exploration

This portfolio offers straightforward and dynamic navigation:

### Side Nav

- Clicking on navigation links loads the corresponding sections seamlessly.

### Mobile Nav

- A hamburger icon will appear on the top right of the page once the mobile breakpoint is reached on the browser window. Clicking this will pull up all the options from the side nav.

## Portfolio Sections

### Home

- The Home Header contains an introduction to myself as well as a dynamic description that changes every 2 seconds. Social links are included below this.

### Work

- The "Work" section provides a timeline of my work history.

### Projects

- The "Projects" section showcases several applications with images and links to their deployment and GitHub repositories.

### Resume

- The "Resume" section provides a download link for my resume.

### Contact

- The contact form utilizes Getform and will validate user entries if they do not input a valid email address.

### Footer

- I opted not to include a 'Get in Touch' section at the footer as it was redundant. The Header accomplishes the linking of icons
